    abstract = { Objectives. To evaluate universal access to clean drinking water by characterizing relationships between community sociodemographics and water contaminants in California domestic well areas (DWAs) and community water systems (CWSs). Methods. We integrated domestic well locations, CWS service boundaries, residential parcels, building footprints, and 2013–2017 American Community Survey data to estimate sociodemographic characteristics for DWAs and CWSs statewide. We derived mean drinking and groundwater contaminant concentrations of arsenic, nitrate, and hexavalent chromium (Cr[VI]) between 2011 and 2019 and used multivariate models to estimate relationships between sociodemographic variables and contaminant concentrations. Results. We estimated that more than 1.3 million Californians (3.4\%) use domestic wells and more than 370 000 Californians rely on drinking water with average contaminant concentrations at or above regulatory standards for 1 or more of the contaminants considered. Higher proportions of people of color were associated with greater drinking water contamination. Conclusions. Poor water quality disproportionately impacts communities of color in California, with the highest estimated arsenic, nitrate, and Cr(VI) concentrations in areas of domestic well use. Domestic well communities must be included in efforts to achieve California’s Human Right to Water. (Am J Public Health. 2022;112(1):88–97. https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306561) }

    abstract = { With this article, we develop the Drinking Water Disparities Framework to explain environmental injustice in the context of drinking water in the United States. The framework builds on the social epidemiology and environmental justice literatures, and is populated with 5 years of field data (2005–2010) from California’s San Joaquin Valley. We trace the mechanisms through which natural, built, and sociopolitical factors work through state, county, community, and household actors to constrain access to safe water and to financial resources for communities. These constraints and regulatory failures produce social disparities in exposure to drinking water contaminants. Water system and household coping capacities lead, at best, to partial protection against exposure. This composite burden explains the origins and persistence of social disparities in exposure to drinking water contaminants. }

abstract = {Summary
Whether you call it the loo, john, privy, lavatory or toilet, this facility is essential wherever humans gather or live: toilet provision has even been called the barometer of civilisation. The modern development of public toilets dates from the late 19th century when sewer systems and water supplies provided hygienic means of dealing with waste, facilitated by public health legislation that also permitted local authorities to provide toilets in town centres. Yet the statutes in the United Kingdom, where the flushing toilet as we know it was invented, never went so far as to require provision of these facilities outside the home. Pressure on resources during the last 20 years has led to many public toilets being closed, for example, 40% of those in London, or to entry charges that reduce accessibility. At the same time an increasingly mobile population has made public toilets even more necessary. Recent public inquiries into public toilet provision in the UK have revealed the impact of the paucity of facilities on the elderly, women, families with young children, ill health that increases the need for toilet use, visitors and poor or homeless members of the community. There has been little attention in public health on the provision of public toilets. With street urination on the increase and less free access to toilets, it is time for public health to recognize a great need and to campaign to turn the tide on public toilet closures, with imaginative planning strategy and associated opportunities to encourage hand washing and other hygiene health promotion.}

Abstract = {US Environmental Protection Agency data were analyzed for violations by community water systems (CWSs). Several characteristics were evaluated, including size, source water, and violation type. The data show that: (1) 55% of CWSs violated at least one regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act that involved systems serving more than 95 million people; (2) the presence of violations was no different for groundwater and surface water systems; (3) fewer than 20% of CWSs with violations exceeded an allowable level of a contaminant in drinking water; (4) smaller water systems are no more likely than larger systems, except very large systems, to violate health-related requirements; and (5) smaller CWSs appear more likely than larger systems to violate monitoring, reporting, and notification requirements. An evaluation was also conducted of four contaminants that had health-related violations by more than 1% of CWSs: total coliform, stage 1 disinfection by-products, arsenic, and lead and c},
